    - easy to setup, no crypto jargon
    - tip and receive tips with or without a bank account(?)
    - withdraw, transfer, mint/stake? tokens immediately

        - Tailor to preferences (flexible / strict)
            - accept tips in certain currencies & networks, set min/max amts
                - e.g. PoS, carbon-neutral blockchains only
            - or let tippers decide how & how much to tip
        - Multiple wallet support
            - add or switch between wallets

## Dead End
- Transak requires $30 minimum per transaction <br>
$30 minimum tip is impractical for mass adoption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src='./public/assets/img/tip-minimum.png' alt='Transak minimum tip' height='150'/>

- Sending tips is against Transak's Terms of Service, unfortunately.<br>
Transak requires that users "have control over the receiving wallet address" <br>
