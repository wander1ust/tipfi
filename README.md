            - or let tippers decide how & how much to tip

## ✅&nbsp; Transak Integration Demo

The following is a proof-of-concept demo that showcases fiat on-ramp integration with Transak for a P2P tipping app. However, to comply with Transak's ToS, the source code can be repurposed as a button/widget generator that allows users (webmasters, bloggers, creators, marketers, etc.) to design and customize their own Transak button, which they can add to their websites, blog posts, or emails.

Featuring vibrant, gradient colors and custom text with eye-catching designs, these buttons will capture the attention of any new user, spark interest, increase conversions, and promote crypto onboarding among even the most crypto-averse crowd.*

#### </> Generate HTML
Enter your wallet address, customize blockchain network & cryptocurrency options, and select integration type (Button / Widget). Copy the generated HTML code & paste it in your website, blog, or email.<p></p><br>

#### *️⃣ Transak button in an app
With the help of this handy-dandy Transak button generator, I was able to quickly customize and add a Transak button to my gift giving app, where gifters can buy crypto with fiat and then send crypto as a gift to another address **💸🎁**.

<br>

## ⛔️&nbsp; Dead End
<!-- <h2> <span style='font-size:40px'>♚</span> Checkmate</h2> -->
- Transak requires $30 minimum per transaction. <br>
 $30 minimum tip is impractical for mass adoption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src='./public/assets/img/tip-minimum.png' alt='Transak minimum tip' height='150'/>

<br>

- Sending tips is against Transak's Terms of Service, unfortunately <strong>😕</strong><br>
Transak users must "have control over the receiving wallet address". <br>
