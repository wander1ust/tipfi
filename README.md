## ✅&nbsp; Transak Integration Demo

The following GIFs capture a proof-of-concept demo that showcases fiat on-ramp integration with Transak for a P2P tipping dapp. However, to comply with Transak's ToS, the source code of TipFi can be repurposed as a button/widget generator that gives Transak partners (webmasters, bloggers, creators, marketers, etc.) a tool to design and customize their own Transak button without needing to peruse the technical docs.

By giving Transak partners a compact, UI friendly tool to customize and integrate Transak into their websites, apps, blogs, and emails with copy-paste-and-go code, the process of setting up shop to onboard fiat to crypto buyers becomes even faster and simpler. The generated result is a prettier, eye-catching, shareable button alternative to plain text link. Consistency in button design, including logo and color scheme, will also improve branding of Transak and Transak Partners (think Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, and PayPal buttons + widgets). In fact, I just did a quick search and found that Buy Me a Coffee has its own snazzy <a href='https://www.buymeacoffee.com/brand' target='_blank'>button + widget maker</a>.

Featuring vibrant, gradient colors and custom text with eye-catching designs, these buttons will capture the attention of any user, spark interest, increase conversions, and promote crypto onboarding among even the most crypto-averse crowd.*

#### *️⃣ Transak button in an app
With the help of this handy-dandy Transak button generator, I was able to quickly customize and add a Transak button to my <a href='https://llclick.com/1jgbnp71/git-readme-tipfi' target='_blank'>gifting app</a>, where gifters can buy crypto with fiat and then send crypto as a gift to a giftee's wallet address **💸🎁**.

<br>

## ⛔️&nbsp; Dead End
<!-- <h2> <span style='font-size:40px'>♚</span> Checkmate</h2> -->
- Transak requires $30 minimum per transaction. <br>
 $30 minimum tip is impractical for mass adoption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src='./public/assets/img/tip-minimum.png' alt='Transak minimum tip' height='150'/>

<br>

- Sending tips is against Transak's Terms of Service, unfortunately <strong>😕</strong><br>
Transak users must "have control over the receiving wallet address". <br>
